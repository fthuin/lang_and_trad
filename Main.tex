    \section{Division operator}
    We followed step-by-step the first chapter of the book to implement the
    \textbf{division} operator. It helped us to understand where was each part
    of the compiler in the code and to have a look at what was already done and
    where we would have to add functionalities.

    \section{Modulo operator}
    The modulo operator is very similar to the division operator, such that
    each modification we made was nearly the same as what we did in the first
    part of this assignment. As it accepts the same limits (in terms of typing
    for example) as division, the idea behind the test was similar (only works
    on integer and sends back the rest of the division).

    \section{Substraction assignment operator}
    The substraction assignment operator was different from the two first
    operators because it is an \textbf{assignment} and not an operator. So we
    had to look at the \verb#JAssignment.java# file and verify what was already
    done for the \textit{addition assignment operator}. The main difference
    between those two operators is that the substraction doesn't work on
    \verb#String#. The tests made are verifying that it only works on \verb#int#
    and that it returns the expected result.

    \section{A \texttt{j--} program: GCD}
    We implemented the gcd function using the substraction assignment operator
    previously described:
    \lstinputlisting[language=Java, frame=single]{gcd.java}
    The tests were made to ensure that it returns the expected result for
    limit cases (one parameter being 0, one parameter being 1, the two
    parameters not having a gcd greater than 1, the two parameters having
    a gcd greater than 1).
