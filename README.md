# LINGI2132 - Language and translators

This repository contains the project of the course Languages and Translators 2015-2016 at Universit√© catholique de Louvain given by Pierre Schaus.

## Project 1: Getting familiar with the j-- compiler

Implement the division, modulo operator, substraction assignment and a GCD method in the j-- compiler.

This project was graded 0.8/1.

## Project 2: Deeper understanding of the j-- compiler : Recursive descent

Using CLEmitter, we had to generate bytecode (almost) manually. The compiler must also ignore multi-line comments and be able to understand both for-loops (basic for and for-each).

There were also theoretic exercises to translate regex to NFA to DFA using Thomson's construction and Hopcroft algorithm.

This project was graded 2.8/3.

## Project 3: Implementing a DSL in scala

Given a fake SMTP server and using JavaMail library, implement a DSL to allow a basic user to send mails, receive mails with some improvements using advanced features of Scala programming language (case classes, flatMap, traits, monads, by-name parameters, implicit conversions,...)

This project was graded 4/4.
